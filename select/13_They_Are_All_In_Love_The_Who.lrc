[00:18.64] Where do you walk on sunny times
[00:22.98] When the rivers gleam and the buildings shine
[00:27.94] How do you feel goin' up hallowed halls
[00:32.78] And the summer clothes brighten gloomy halls
[00:54.78] 
[00:41.14] And they're all in love
[00:45.74] And they're all in love
[00:57.24] 
[00:52.99] Where do you fit in zzzzip magazine
[00:57.49] Where the past is the hero and the present a queen
[01:02.35] Just tell me right now where do you fit in
[01:06.64] With mud in your eye and a passion for gin
[01:27.64] 
[01:20.01] And they're all in love
[01:24.93] And they're all in love
[01:36.43] 
[02:10.56] Hey, goodbye all you punks; stay young and stay high
[02:15.55] Hand me my checkbook and I'll crawl out to die
[02:19.95] But like a woman in childbirth grown ugly in a flash
[02:24.80] I'm seen magic and fame now I'm recycling trash
[02:48.30] 
[02:37.96] And they're all in love
[02:42.90] And they're all in love
[02:47.79] And they're all in love
[02:52.46] And they're all in love
