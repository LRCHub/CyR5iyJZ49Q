I was lifted up high
To a hole in the sky
Where God told me to dig
I found figures of pigs
He put his butchers to work
With a competent clerk
Executing those who
Had abandoned the truth

Then four faces appeared
Around the sides of sphere
Spinning over a throne
Made of amber and bone
The ball was covered with eyes
And as it started to rise
God commanded the clerk
To take me back to the dirt

With words harder than stone
His voice followed me home
It said He was coming to eat
My cousins who were his meat
